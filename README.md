# solana-rock-paper-scissors

Baby's first ~smart contract~ solana program

- Uses borsh serialization and dispatches different instructions based off what's deserialized.
- Client hasn't been updated (it's just the helloworld default client and is probably broken)
- Would be neat to allow players to escrow 'bets' along with their move, whoever wins gets the pot
